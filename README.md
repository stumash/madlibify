## Mvp

we will allow you to download a chrome extension called madlibify.
when you click the extension's icon, you see two buttons: mablibify and wordset.

when you click wordset, a dialog opens up where you can edit the worset you want to apply to the page.
this dialog contains columns which represent word lists, including the following categories: 
singular nouns, present indicative verbs, adjectives.
they can add words for each category.

when you click madlibify, the web page you are currently visiting will have some of its words replaced with their gramatically.
equivalent counterpart (nouns get replaced with nouns, verbs with verbs, etc.).
This will be done by checking every word on the page in the dictionary.
The program will go through all text on the page indescriminently and do all possible replacements given the user's wordset.
once it reaches the end of the list of a given category (i.e. it runs out of nouns), it reshuffles the list then restarts from the beginning.
The program will stop once all possible replacements have been made on the page.
